The Brisket (20% of the blend) and Picanha (5%) each contribute amazingly rich flavor, with their slightly fattier composition, while the leaner and more conventional ground Chuck (75%) brings additional \u2018beefiness\u2019 and balance.</p>\r\n<p>All of this amounts to a Ground Beef blend that is about 75% lean/25% fat\u2014ideal for quick, hot grilling. And the substantial size of these pre-portioned 1/3 lb. Patties allows them to remain tender &amp; juicy, even when cooked over the flames.

We like our Shrimp Scampi as a simple, satisfying, no-fuss entr\u00e9e for a busy weeknight dinner, especially when paired with a side of roasted broccoli, a baked potato, and a crisp and fruity white wine\u2014something like our subtly sparkly Espiral Vinho Verde, for example.</p>", "sale_prices": [8.99], "prices": [8.99], "images": ["https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m20602/74951.png"], "url": "https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/shrimp-scampi-074951", "brand": "Trader Joe's", "models": [{"variants": [{"id": "074951-shrimp-scampi", "image": "https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m20602/74951.png", "price": 8.99, "uom": "Oz"}]}]}

We wanted to get it just right, and while there were plenty of options out there from the get-go, most of them weren\u2019t very good. We wanted really good. And we got it, in the most seemingly simple way\u2014we started with the cheese. Trader Joe\u2019s Breaded Mozzarella Cheese Sticks begin with really good, part skim mozzarella cheese from Wisconsin.\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>Once we knew we had the right cheese, we set about perfecting the breading. Restaurant versions are crunchy, but most bake-at-home versions become a soggy mess very quickly. The solution to the soggy mess situation was panko bread crumbs, lightly seasoned with garlic butter flavor.

In fact, the actual cheeriness of these Crackers came first, prompted by the bright yellow yogurt coating and rainbow-colored nonpareils-aka crunchy candy sprinkles. (Incidentally, all the happy hues in these Crackers derive from simple sources including vegetable juice, beta-carotene, and turmeric.)</p>\r\n<p>The <em>grinspiration</em> of these Crackers is further found in the chipper crunch of their lightly sweet, cookie-like character. Multiplying this mirth, each Cracker is cut into one of 13 unique &amp; gladsome Animals, including: bears, elephants, cats, donkeys, goats, tigers, lions, horses, cows, rhinos, camels, bison, and hippos. And the capstone of this trouble-tromping Trader Joe's treat is its creamy, yogurt coating, with authentic citrus aroma &amp; lemony zing.</p>\r\n<p>May we mention one more aspect of Trader Joe's Lemon Animal Crackers that is sure to elicit cheer?

Xiao Long Bao are essentially soup dumplings, but instead of dumplings that go in the soup (though you can still certainly make this happen), the soup actually goes inside these dumplings.

Once the soup is wrapped in the dough and sealed (Bao means \u201cwrapped\u201d in Chinese), it is steamed until fully cooked (Xiao Long refers to a traditional Chinese bamboo steamer). Lastly, our dumplings are put into microwave-safe packages and frozen so we can deliver them to you.</p>\r\n<p>To enjoy, you simply cut the corner of the bag and microwave for 1 to 2 minutes. Let your Dumplings sit for at least another minute before removing from microwave. The insides will be very hot, so be careful!

They deliver authenticity and are adept in their stuffing of somethings. Trader Joe\u2019s Dolmas are crafted according to an age-old, Mediterranean recipe, using tender vine leaves. By hand, the leaves are stuffed, one by one, with a soft, succulent white rice that\u2019s mixed with chopped onions, bits of dill and mint. Dexterously rolled and folded, the leaves and rice are transformed into two-bite morsels, which are cooked to marry flavors and create a moist, tender bite. Packed in soy oil, they eat like they were freshly prepared and promise a little spice, a little savory and a little tang. Enjoy them cold, as a snack, or serve them warm with a dipping sauce \u2013 Tzatziki, lemon tahini (tahini, lemon juice &amp; garlic - blended), or greek yogurt &amp; fresh dill \u2013 for an iconic meze. They pair well with a dry white, like a Sauvignon Blanc.</p>", "sale_prices": [3.49], "prices": [3.49], "images": ["https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m20902/50752.png"], "url": "https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/dolmas-050752", "brand": "Trader Joe's", "models": [{"variants": [{"id": "050752-dolmas", "image": "https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m20902/50752.png", "price": 3.49, "uom": "Oz"}]}]}

And the chickens were raised on all-vegetarian feed, with no antibiotics ever, and no added hormones. Second, we\u2019ve gone ahead and Brined the Breast for you, with a seasoning mix that includes salt, sugar, white pepper, and garlic &amp; onion powders. Aside from the flavor benefits of this marinade, brining helps keep the meat moist and tender through the cooking process. Using salt to keep moisture in might seem a little counter-intuitive, but there\u2019s some real science to it: Typically, as proteins cook, the muscle fibers shrink, which squeezes out moisture. Salt slows down this squeezing process, allowing muscle fibers to absorb the moisture instead, creating juicier, more flavorful results.</p>\r\n<p>And speaking of flavor, since these Breasts are Bone-In, they retain even more moisture while cooking, which complements all the taste-benefits the brining brings. Consequently, they need only minimal seasoning, if any, prior to cooking.

Using Madagascar-grown vanilla beans (which, like all natural vanilla, are actually the seed pods of a tropical orchid ), our supplier makes each batch with twice the amount of vanilla as a standard strength extract (hence, Double Fold.) They then further fortify it with Vanilla Bean Seeds, resulting in a pleasantly potent Vanilla Extract that provides an impressive pop of vanilla flavor to cakes, pies, cookies, sauces, cocktails, and everything in between.</p>\r\n<p>With its elegantly-styled, long-necked bottle and charming cork stopper, Trader Joe\u2019s Double Fold Vanilla Extract with Vanilla Bean Seeds is an apt and attractive addition to any pantry, and makes an ideal gift for home bakers of all experience levels. Perhaps some stores would be content enough with these estimable aesthetic and culinary qualities, but since this is Trader Joe\u2019s, we\u2019ve gone the additional step of making its value exceptional, too: while supplies last, you can pick up of a bottle of our Double Fold Vanilla Extract for a fraction of the price you\u2019d pay for extracts of similar quality elsewhere.</p>", "sale_prices": [7.99], "prices": [7.99], "images": ["https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m20905/76665.png"], "url": "https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/hol-vanilla-extract-2-fold-with-seeds-076665", "brand": "Trader Joe's", "models": [{"variants": [{"id": "076665-hol-vanilla-extract-2-fold-with-seeds", "image": "https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m20905/76665.png", "price": 7.99, "uom": "Oz"}]}]}

Of course, the Reinheitsgebot has been updated since the 16th century to make way for other beer styles, including Hefeweizen, which necessarily includes wheat in its recipe.</p>\r\n<p>Josephsbrau Hefeweizen is fermented with a special wheat beer yeast strain from Bavaria (hefeweizen literally means: \u201cwheat yeast\u201d). This unique yeast produces an array of flavors typical of an authentic Hefeweizen including: citrus, clove, banana, and even hints of bubble gum. This beer\u2019s unfiltered golden color, combined with its lightly hopped, lightly malted character, makes it wonderfully refreshing to sip by itself. It also pairs extremely well with a grilled Uncured Bavarian Bratwurst or our Sweet Italian Chicken Sausage.</p>", "sale_prices": [5.99], "prices": [5.99], "images": ["https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/beer/75189.png"], "url": "https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/josephsbrau-bavarian-hefeweizen-can-175189", "brand": "Trader Joe's", "models": [{"variants": [{"id": "175189-josephsbrau-bavarian-hefeweizen-can", "image": "https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/beer/75189.png", "price": 5.99, "uom": "Fl Oz"}]}]}

In admiration of those innovators who created this Italian classic, we\u2019ve done a little tradition-twisting of our own in the creation of Trader Joe\u2019s Gnocchi Alla Romana.</p>\r\n<p>The package includes four, drum-shaped, Cheesy Semolina Gratins made from durum wheat semolina flour, and enriched with butter, Grana Padano PDO cheese (the real deal!), and egg yolks. These relatively \u201cgiant\u201d Gnocchi are rich and silky, with a savory seasoning of sea salt, sage, and nutmeg. Instead of appearing layered together in a baking dish, each of the four Gnocchi is cradled in its own paper cup, like a cheesy, buttery cupcake. To enjoy, one needs only to heat one or more Gnocchi in the microwave (1-4 minutes), or conventional oven (about 20 minutes).</p>\r\n<p>But when to enjoy Trader Joe\u2019s Gnocchi Alla Romana? We recommend pairing these Cheesy Semolina Gratins with a bowl of steaming soup, or a fresh green salad.

It is usually added before or during cooking, often when oil is heating, which helps to draw out the aromatics and allow them to meld into the recipe.

The concept piqued their interest but the peppers were just a little too sweet. So, for this product they concocted the perfect balance of sweetness to complement\u2014but not overpower\u2014the heat of the jalape\u00f1os. And, yes, these are spicy; they\u2019ll certainly pack the punch you\u2019d expect from the small but mighty jalape\u00f1o. Grown in Mexico and Canada, the sliced jalape\u00f1os are pickled in a concoction of sugar, vinegar, salt, jalape\u00f1o puree, garlic, and a whole red chili pepper. The final result? A palatable, perfectly pickled\u2014and sweet\u2014pepper.</p>\r\n<p>Perplexed about how to put our Hot &amp; Sweet Jalape\u00f1os to use? Pop \u2018em in your mouth like candy. Top a heap- ing plate of nachos with several slices. Spice up a hamburger or grilled cheese. Add to guacamole. Serve with crackers and cream cheese. Place as a pickled accompaniment for charcuterie. And then, when the jalape\u00f1os are gone, use the brine for a marinade.

After a brisk three to four minutes in boiling water, they take on a delightful al dente texture and can be served as simply (with a splash of olive oil and a pinch of crushed red pepper) or as sauce-fully (tossed with warm Vegan Kale, Cashew &amp; Basil Pesto, for instance) as you\u2019d like.</p>", "sale_prices": [3.99], "prices": [3.99], "images": ["https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m20503/71761.png", "https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/context-images/71761-vegan-cashew-ravioli-2-pdp.jpg"], "url": "https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/pasta-ravioli-italian-vegan-spinach-cashew-071761", "brand": "Trader Joe's", "models": [{"variants": [{"id": "071761-pasta-ravioli-italian-vegan-spinach-cashew", "image": "https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m20503/71761.png", "price": 3.99, "uom": "Oz"}]}]}

First, our distillery partner takes their estate-grown agave and roasts it in conical, underground pits, a process which both releases the agave nectar from the plant and gives it its signature smoky notes (tequila, which is technically a kind of mezcal, has a similar process, but uses above-ground brick ovens for roasting, which results in far less smoke in the finished product). Then, their head mezcalero, a third-generation mezcal distiller, ferments the nectar using traditional methods passed down through the decades. The result is a sublimely smoky Mezcal, slightly sweet, a little green and savory, and with a satisfyingly citric edge.

They can be baked, roasted, fried, grilled, boiled, mashed or grated. Make sweet potato biscuits, stuffing, soup, pie, casserole. Or you can sweeten them by baking and adding a little butter or maple syrup, and topping them off with some brown sugar. Look for sweet potatoes that are firm and do not have bruises, soft spots or cracks. Store in a cool dry place and do not refrigerate, as cold temperatures alter the flavor and shorten the shelf life.</p>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>", "sale_prices": [0.89], "prices": [0.89], "images": ["https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m20702/97997.png"], "url": "https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/potato-sweet-each-097997", "brand": "Trader Joe's", "models": [{"variants": [{"id": "097997-potato-sweet-each", "image": "https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m20702/97997.png", "price": 0.89, "uom": "Each"}]}]}

In fact, it can also be used to simply sprinkle over already-prepared foods to give them a little extra kick: try adding a pinch of this Mix the next time you want to take your burger, mac and cheese, ramen, or skillet-seared salmon to excitingly spicy new places.</p>", "sale_prices": [0.99], "prices": [0.99], "images": ["https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m20906/93089.png"], "url": "https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/spice-taco-seasoning-mix-1-3oz-093089", "brand": "Trader Joe's", "models": [{"variants": [{"id": "093089-spice-taco-seasoning-mix-1-3oz", "image": "https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m20906/93089.png", "price": 0.99, "uom": "Oz"}]}]}

They take particularly well to being modified with seasonings and spices, allowing you a large amount of leeway to experiment: try sprinkling generously with some of our Mushroom &amp; Company, Ajika, or even some Cheesy Seasoning Blend for even more flavor. And, like any good fry, they\u2019re especially amenable to dipping in ketchups, barbecue sauces, or special spreads like our Magnifisauce.</p>", "sale_prices": [3.99], "prices": [3.99], "images": ["https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m20602/66323.png"], "url": "https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/hol-fries-root-vegetable-066323", "brand": "Trader Joe's", "models": [{"variants": [{"id": "066323-hol-fries-root-vegetable", "image": "https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m20602/66323.png", "price": 3.99, "uom": "Oz"}]}]}

Instead of using these chemicals, however, the South Korean farmers who grow our Organic Seaweed use two natural methods to control pests. Seaweed is grown on ropes that are either attached to floating buoys, or to fixed poles in shallower tidal waters. When the buoys rotate, the seaweed is exposed to sunlight. Likewise, when the tide is low, the poles are \u201craised\u201d out of the water, allowing sunlight to reach the seaweed. In both cases, it\u2019s the exposure to sunlight that naturally controls the growth of unwanted species on the crop.</p>\r\n<p>Once harvested, this seaweed is roasted, cut, lightly misted with organic sunflower oil, &amp; sprinkled with sea salt (the oil makes the salt stick.)

And that\u2019s before we get to its boundless baking opportunities: the creamy center of a vegan danish, the swirl in a pan of vegan brownies, or the frosting of a vegan red velvet or carrot cake aren\u2019t just possible, they\u2019re now all as simple as grabbing a tub of Trader Joe\u2019s Vegan Cream Cheese Alternative from your neighborhood Trader Joe\u2019s cheese section.", "sale_prices": [2.99], "prices": [2.99], "images": ["https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m20204/70942.png"], "url": "https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/vegan-cream-cheese-alternative-070942", "brand": "Trader Joe's", "models": [{"variants": [{"id": "070942-vegan-cream-cheese-alternative", "image": "https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m20204/70942.png", "price": 2.99, "uom": "Oz"}]}]}

That\u2019s equivalent to about 96 ounces of coffee beverages when reconstituted with water, milk, etc. If you like it strong and steamy, mix it with a bit of hot water for a smooth cup. Or pour it over some ice for a cold cold brew. If you want to keep the coffee as concentrated as possible, you can use it to make coffee ice cubes for your iced coffee.

But since Sweet Baby Thompsons grow as nature intended on uncut vines (probably why this variety is also called \u201cNatural Thompson Grapes\u201d), they don\u2019t swell as much with excess water, thus remaining smaller\u2014and also wonderfully sweet!", "sale_prices": [2.99], "prices": [2.99], "images": ["https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m20701/61959.png"], "url": "https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/grapes-sweet-baby-thompson-sdless-1lb-061959", "brand": "Trader Joe's", "models": [{"variants": [{"id": "061959-grapes-sweet-baby-thompson-sdless-1lb", "image": "https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m20701/61959.png", "price": 2.99, "uom": "Each"}]}]}

That means all-natural fermentation. No vinegar added. No lab cultures to kick-start the process. No cooking or pasteurization. It\u2019s just raw cabbage and cucumbers with some sea salt and garlic.

The loaded disc is then pre-cut into wedges that will puff up when you bake them at home. Once you do bake this pie (in the provided ovenable tray at 350\u00b0F for about a half-hour), you\u2019ll have yourself a crisp, buttery pastry with a delectable filling. \r\n\r\nOur Spanakopita makes a great snack anytime, and it can also serve as a light meal when paired with a fresh salad of tomatoes, olives, and greens, and lightly dressed with a bit of olive oil and lemon juice.", "sale_prices": [4.49], "prices": [4.49], "images": ["https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m20601/55248.png"], "url": "https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/spanakopita-greek-spinach-and-cheese-pie-055248", "brand": "Trader Joe's", "models": [{"variants": [{"id": "055248-spanakopita-greek-spinach-and-cheese-pie", "image": "https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m20601/55248.png", "price": 4.49, "uom": "Oz"}]}]}

Tender and rich, the pasta glows golden, courtesy of the egg. Rolled thin and custom cut to resemble a sunflower, it is then filled with fresh ricotta, naturally creamy and slightly sweet, that is mixed with lemon zest and balanced with butter, bread crumbs and salt. The bite captures a sunny, summer day in Sicily.\r\n\r\nWhile all of the elements are essential, the lemons paint the picture.

Since then, there\u2019s never really been one definitive recipe for a bolognese sauce \u2014 many iterations don\u2019t even include tomatoes \u2014 other than a commonality of braised beef, veal, or pork as the center of the dish. In other words, out of reach for non-carnivores. Until today, that is: Trader Joe\u2019s Vegan Bolognese Style Pasta Sauce evokes all the savory splendor of a perfectly seasoned bolognese, but does so with tender crumbles made of pea protein, resulting in a sauce with as much protein as its meat-based cousins.\r\n\r\nMade with tomatoes imported from Italy, our Vegan Bolognese is rich and satisfying to vegans and non- vegans alike with lightly herbaceous and peppery notes. Like our other jarred pasta sauces, preparation is as simple as warming on the stovetop until heated through, then mixing with freshly cooked and drained pasta.

The cattle are 100% grass fed, grazing on wide-open pastures \u2013 their diet of natural grasses and vegetation contributes to full-flavored, well-marbled beef that\u2019s rich in Omega-3 fatty acids.

First described in print in the late 1800s, rag\u00f9 alla bolognese started as a descendent of French rago\u00fbt, a hearty, meat-based stew. Since then, there\u2019s never really been one definitive recipe for a bolognese sauce \u2014 many iterations don\u2019t even include tomatoes \u2014 other than a commonality of braised beef, veal, or pork as the center of the dish. In other words, out of reach for non-carnivores. Until today, that is: Trader Joe\u2019s Vegan Bolognese Style Pasta Sauce evokes all the savory splendor of a perfectly seasoned bolognese, but does so with tender crumbles made of pea protein, resulting in a sauce with as much protein as its meat-based cousins.\r\n\r\nMade with tomatoes imported from Italy, our Vegan Bolognese is rich and satisfying to vegans and non- vegans alike with lightly herbaceous and peppery notes. Like our other jarred pasta sauces, preparation is as simple as warming on the stovetop until heated through, then mixing with freshly cooked and drained pasta. While spaghetti is a popular pairing choice outside of Italy, within Bologna itself, it's more often made with flatter, broader noodles like pappardelle, or tube shapes like macaroni or rigatoni, both of which complement its thicker, meatier texture.", "sale_prices": [3.49], "prices": [3.49], "images": ["https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m20402/70839.png"], "url": "https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/pasta-sauce-bolognese-vegan-070839", "brand": "Trader Joe's", "models": [{"variants": [{"id": "070839-pasta-sauce-bolognese-vegan", "image": "https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m20402/70839.png", "price": 3.49, "uom": "Oz"}]}]}

Our Kansas City Style BBQ Sauce was a longtime resident on our shelves that upheld this meaty tradition with aplomb, but over the years, its ingredient deck started to fall out of line with current trends. Retiring this old standby allowed us to make room for a new sauce that we think will be an instant classic: Trader Joe's Organic Kansas City Style BBQ Sauce.\r\n\r\nOur Organic Kansas City Style BBQ Sauce went through extensive tasting panel review prior to its approval-after all, the old sauce was a customer favorite for a reason! (and eating BBQ week after week wasn't bad, either). Our goal was to emulate the irresistible tanginess of the previous sauce, while at the same time reducing the sugar and balancing the smoke. We think we accomplished it, with a base of tomato puree, brown sugar and molasses for tang and sweetness, amped up with natural hickory smoke flavor. Onion powder and garlic powder add savory notes, rounded out by paprika and chipotle powder for a smoky finish.

We would be remiss, however, if we didn't suggest giving them an extra flavor boost by lightly toasting them in an oven at 400&deg;F for a few minutes prior to eating.\r\n\r\nEach Roll is perfectly sized for making sandwiches and sliders, be it with your favorite deli meats and fixings, burger-based accoutrements, or, our personal favorite, leftovers from the night before. Please join us in welcoming Trader Joe's Organic French Rolls to our already-illustrious collection of artisan-style breads.

And we could say, if we were prone to hyperbole and self-aggrandizement, that Trader Joe's has been instrumental in orchestrating that moment. What we will say, clearly, is that the early and exciting success of our Green Jackfruit in Brine led us to the realization that American palates have an appetite for jackfruit. And that realization led us to the creation of Trader Joe's Yellow Jackfruit Curry with Jasmine Rice.\r\n\r\nJackfruit grows in abundance in Thailand, which is where our supplier is located. They've sourced green (unripe) jackfruit here; at this stage in the ripening process, the fruit cooks to a meat-like consistency and mild flavor that's ready to take on the flavor of any sauce.\r\n\r\nHere, we've paired it with a creamy, coconut milk-based yellow curry sauce, created in-house with a yellow curry paste rich in freshly ground herbs and spices including lemongrass, cumin, and turmeric. To release the fragrant aromatics, the curry paste is cooked over medium heat, then slowly simmered with coconut milk to create a rich, vibrantly flavored sauce. That sauce is the perfect partner to tender pieces of jackfruit and chunks of eggplant and red bell pepper.\r\n\r\nAnd what's a curry without rice? Incomplete, that's what. So we've included a sidecar of white jasmine rice; its fragrant aroma and slightly chewy texture make it the ideal carbohydrate companion for this easy to heat and enjoy entr&eacute;e.", "sale_prices": [2.99], "prices": [2.99], "images": ["https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m20602/59976.png"], "url": "https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/jackfruit-yellow-curry-059976", "brand": "Trader Joe's", "models": [{"variants": [{"id": "059976-jackfruit-yellow-curry", "image": "https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m20602/59976.png", "price": 2.99, "uom": "Oz"}]}]}

It starts with a base of velvety coconut milk, and an incredibly flavorful, spicy green curry paste. Packed into this paste are shallots, lemongrass, garlic, galangal, coriander seed, Thai lime peel, ginger, turmeric and cumin-all contributing to its savory, aromatic awesomeness. The Sauce is rounded out with rice bran oil, sugar, basil leaf and green chili for just the right amount of heat.\r\n\r\nTo get your fill of Green Curry goodness, saut&eacute; a half-pound of your favorite protein or tofu until cooked through.

So the next time you're craving walnut shrimp, don't try to find the time to create it from scratch or call for takeout, check out Trader Joe's Honey Walnut Shrimp in our freezer case.\r\n\r\nInspired by numerous restaurant versions of this dish, we set out to create an easy-to-make iteration you could have on the table in less time than it would take to have it delivered. What we found with some of the restaurant versions was an abundance of batter, and pretty small shrimp. We're using large shrimp and a batter that lightly coats the shrimp, yet manages to retain its crunch even after it's been combined with the sauce. (Comparable restaurant versions are 40% batter; ours are 30% batter.)\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the sauce, it's a sweet, creamy concoction that's finished with a hint of pineapple to give the flavor a bright boost. And we couldn't have Honey Walnut Shrimp without walnuts, right? Every package contains candied walnuts you toss with the shrimp and sauce before serving. All of the components are packaged separately, and the bag has detailed instructions that will yield delicious results.\r\n\r\nIt's not at all complicated, really - saut&eacute; or bake shrimp, toss with sauce, top with walnuts.

While they're perfectly delicious when enjoyed as a quick, on-the-go breakfast snack or brunch side, we contend that they truly excel when heated up a bit in the toaster oven or microwave - the aromatics of warm blueberries alone are well worth the price of admission. After that, we recommend a generous application of butter, a drizzling of honey, or a sizeable spreading of Trader Joe's Authentic Lemon Curd.\r\n\r\n", "sale_prices": [4.99], "prices": [4.99], "images": ["https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m20105/64741.png"], "url": "https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/muffins-blueberry-064741", "brand": "Trader Joe's", "models": [{"variants": [{"id": "064741-muffins-blueberry", "image": "https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m20105/64741.png", "price": 4.99, "uom": "Oz"}]}]}

You may be thinking: What makes Paratha different from Naan?\r\n\r\nYou may also be thinking, Didn't Trader Joe's carry this product once before?  Well, we did, and to be honest, sales weren't exactly spectacular. But given how popular our frozen Indian items are (not to mention how delicious this Paratha is), we decided we simply had to give it another chance to shine. Alas, we digress. Onto the Paratha itself!\r\n\r\nOne difference between the aforementioned Naan and Trader Joe's Malabari Paratha is in the ingredients. Our Malabari Paratha (made in the tradition of the Malabar region of Southern India) includes wheat flour, cow's & buffalo's milk, and a little bit of sugar & salt. In contrast, traditional Naan typically incorporates yogurt and yeast in its recipe.\r\n\r\nAnother difference is in the way these breads are formed. Our Paratha (like traditional Paratha) is formed by hand using a unique process in which thin rounds of dough are rolled into long ropes, which are then rolled into spirals that kind of look like cinnamon buns. Finally, they are pressed back into flattened rounds. (Paratha literally means \"layers of cooked flour.\")\r\n\r\nMore simply, Naan dough is flattened as it's slapped on the inside of the Tandoori oven to cook-which leads to the final difference: Trader Joe's Malabari Paratha is cooked on flat, griddle-like stoves.\r\n\r\nHeat our Malabari Paratha from frozen in a lightly oiled, non-stick pan until golden, and you'll find a bite that is crisp on the outside and soft & moist on the inside.

Its mild flavor makes it a must-have when putting together a cheese plate. Roll up a slice and slide it on a toothpick with pickled vegetables for an easy, party-worthy appetizer.

India AA Robusta, known for its caffeine levels, and a Brazilian Arabica coffee with nutty, chocolatey notes have been combined to create a blend with great flavor and a jolt of caffeine.\r\n\r\nElectric Buzz is conveniently portioned into twelve single-serve cups for use with your Keurig K-Cup&reg;* coffee maker.

And, of course, each bite only furthers that spirit of unity, with the milk chocolate laying a smooth, creamy foundation, upon which the dark chocolate builds striking cocoa flavor which intermingles superbly with the sugary crunch of flawlessly dispersed granules of butterscotch.

In other words, it helps add shine and luster to even the dullest of mane, all without weighing it down. It's also free of parabens, sulfates, phthalates, and surfactants (which can strip hair color & affect hair texture) and is never tested on animals.\r\n\r\nOur Hair Serum is suitable for all hair types, and it's perfect for use before or after heat styling.

And that realization led us to the creation of Trader Joe's Yellow Jackfruit Curry with Jasmine Rice.\r\n\r\nJackfruit grows in abundance in Thailand, which is where our supplier is located. They've sourced green (unripe) jackfruit here; at this stage in the ripening process, the fruit cooks to a meat-like consistency and mild flavor that's ready to take on the flavor of any sauce.\r\n\r\nHere, we've paired it with a creamy, coconut milk-based yellow curry sauce, created in-house with a yellow curry paste rich in freshly ground herbs and spices including lemongrass, cumin, and turmeric. To release the fragrant aromatics, the curry paste is cooked over medium heat, then slowly simmered with coconut milk to create a rich, vibrantly flavored sauce. That sauce is the perfect partner to tender pieces of jackfruit and chunks of eggplant and red bell pepper.\r\n\r\nAnd what's a curry without rice? Incomplete, that's what.

What we found with some of the restaurant versions was an abundance of batter, and pretty small shrimp. We're using large shrimp and a batter that lightly coats the shrimp, yet manages to retain its crunch even after it's been combined with the sauce. (Comparable restaurant versions are 40% batter; ours are 30% batter.)\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the sauce, it's a sweet, creamy concoction that's finished with a hint of pineapple to give the flavor a bright boost.

All of the components are packaged separately, and the bag has detailed instructions that will yield delicious results.\r\n\r\nIt's not at all complicated, really - saut&eacute; or bake shrimp, toss with sauce, top with walnuts.

In true bean-to-bar fashion, the cacao is harvested, dried, and fermented in partnership with a 3rd generation, family-owned Italian chocolatier. But don't assume this partnership is a long-distance relationship. In fact, one of the Italian Executive Directors is based in Uganda where he helps guarantee the origin of the beans from Ugandan farmers who still own the lands on which the cacao is cultivated.
